# Bulls and Cows Game

Pretty much what it is. To those that *aren't* aware of this word game, here's a quick rundown:

 * The game, according the user's word length, picks a word (an *isogram*).
 * The player's duty is to try and guess the word.

Pretty simple, right? So, how does the player knows he's got the word spot-on? He has *clues* throughout in the form of **bulls** and **cows**. *But how does this work*? Here's an example:

* The hidden word is *"ant"*.
>If the player inputs the word *"abn"*, he'll get **1 Bull** (the 'a' letter exists **and** is in the right position) and **1 Cow** (the 'n' letter exists **but** it's in the wrong position).


That's pretty much the game. If it wasn't obvious yet, this is just for practice purposes (also to further perfect my markdown editing skills, I guess).


Have fun! :+1:
